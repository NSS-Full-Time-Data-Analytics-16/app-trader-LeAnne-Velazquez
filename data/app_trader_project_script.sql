--(A)RECOMMENDATIONS:
	--PRICE RANGE: $0-$3 has most reviews so perhaps more popular 
	--GENRE: games, entertainment 
	--AUDIENCE: 4+/Everyone, Teen
	
	--(NOTES)
	
	--then get counts of genre with reviews greater than 3.5 

	
--- THE FOLLOWING QUERY WILL SHOW THE APP NAME, RATING, GENRE, PRICE, RVW_COUNT, AND CONTENT RATING FOR 
	---RATING 4.0+
	---PRICE BETWEEN $0-$3
	---(p.s.) ignored the google play price altogether because its considered text

--(B)
-- If both the high and low cost apps will earn the same on advertising (5,000/mo) and marketing (1,000/mo) then it would be most cost-effective to purchase the highest rated apps that are lowest cost
-- so amended the query for max profitability:
	--RATING of 4.5+
	--Price of $0
-- and also omitting platform review counts
